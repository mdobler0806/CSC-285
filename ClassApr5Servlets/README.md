# Calculator Web App

My app is a simple calculator application that takes two numbers and an operation type
from the user and then gives the result.

To run my program:
1. mvn jetty:run
2. Go to URL: http://localhost:8080/calculator
3. Enter a number in each of the number text fields.
4. Choose operation you would like to do between the two numbers respectively.
5. See result page. Return to calculator with button if you would like.
